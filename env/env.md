### Environment installation

You will need an installation of Conda on your system to be able to import `environment.yml` and therefore tell Conda which packages it needs to use to generate the data analysis and machine learning results presented here.

To import, in Conda prompt type `conda env create -f "environment.yml"` and then activate the environment using `conda activate ./env`.
